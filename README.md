# STEM Incremental – A Math-Based Idle Game

**By Logan Suvajdzin**

STEM Incremental is a creative idle/clicker game that teaches players math and computer science concepts through gameplay.

## 🔧 How to Play

 1. Gain Knowledge: Click the "🧠 Solve Problem" button to earn your initial Knowledge Points.
 
 3. Buy Upgrades: Use your KP to purchase upgrades from the right-hand panel. These upgrades can increase the KP you get per click or grant you passive KP generation over time.

 4. Unlock the Glossary: As you purchase new concepts (upgrades), they will be added to your "📘 Glossary," where you can read a short description of each one.

 5. Earn Achievements: As you reach certain milestones—like clicking a certain number of times or earning a specific amount of KP—you will unlock achievements. You can view your progress in the "🏆 Achievements" panel.

 6. Prestige: Once you've earned a large number of Knowledge Points, you can choose to "Prestige." This will reset your progress (KP, upgrades) but give you a permanent boost to the KP you earn per click, allowing you to progress faster on your next run.

## 🧠 Educational Value
Each upgrade is inspired by real concepts:

- **Loops** – Teaches iteration

- **Recursion** – Introduces self-referencing functions

- **Fibonacci** – Demonstrates sequences in nature and math
