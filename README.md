# Code Increment â€“ A Math-Based Idle Game

**By Logan [Age 14â€“17 Category]**

Code Increment is a creative idle/clicker game that teaches players math and computer science concepts through gameplay.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

- Click "Solve Problem" to earn Knowledge Points (KP)
- Buy upgrades like **Loops**, **Recursion**, and **Fibonacci** to boost KP generation
- Each upgrade is based on a real math or CS concept and includes a short explanation
- Your progress is saved automatically

## ðŸ§  Educational Value

Each upgrade is inspired by real concepts:
- **Loops** â€“ Teaches iteration
- **Recursion** â€“ Introduces self-referencing functions
- **Fibonacci** â€“ Demonstrates sequences in nature and math

## ðŸ’¡ Tech Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- No external libraries
- Saves using browser `localStorage`
